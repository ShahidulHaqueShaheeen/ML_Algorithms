# ML_Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various **Machine Learning algorithms**, with a focus on understanding their working principles and applications. More algorithms will be added over time as the repository evolves.

## Overview
- Includes fundamental algorithms such as:
  - **Gradient Descent**: Optimization algorithm to minimize loss functions.
  - **Linear Regression**: Predicts continuous outcomes using a linear relationship.
  - **Logistic Regression**: Handles binary classification problems.
  - **Polynomial Regression**: Extends linear regression by fitting non-linear data.
  - **Regularization**: Techniques like Lasso and Ridge to prevent overfitting.

- In future, more algorithms and advanced topics will be added to broaden the scope of this repository.
- Uses libraries such as **NumPy, pandas**, and **scikit-learn** for implementation and experimentation.
